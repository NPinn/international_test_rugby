## Project Purpose
- This is a Data Science/Analytics Project looking to build a database of all Rugby Tests played throughout history
- From this; historical rankings can be calculated, as well as head-to-heads and each Nation's/Teams Perfomance
- Tournament Perofmances can also be tracked, where appropriate
------
## Tasks:
1. Scrape all Tests from the [List of Women's Test Matches Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women%27s_international_rugby_union_test_matches) (Complete)
    1. Recursively extract tournament results from linked pages (TBC)
    - As of 07/10/25:
        - Scraping Tournaments from Wikipedia proved to require more manual refinment than initially thought
        - An API will be used instead, with this being revisited later
2. Structure Results, including indications for Home Team and Tournament
3. Build Historical Rankings
    1. Will need to consult World Rugby for how rankings are (and have been) done
4. Build Head-To-Heads & Team Performances
5. [Scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com), but Rugby?
