# The History of Scoring in Rugby Union
-----
- The history of scoring in Rugby Union is a fascinating subject, and has seen numerous changes since the inception of rugby
    - For instance, the first 14 years of international rugby saw matches decided by the number of goals scored, rather than the number of points scored
- The table highlighted in this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rugby_union#Scoring) page will act as the guide for changes in scoring
    - This data is sourced from [Rugby Football History](https://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/), specifically their page on [Scoring Through the Ages](https://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm)

## Scoring over Time
| Date      | Try | Conversion      | Penalty | Dropped Goal      | Goal From Mark | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1871 - 1875 | No Score | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | N/A | Matches decided by a majority of Goals. A Try was required to score a conversion-goal |
| 1876 - 1885 | 1 Try | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | N/A | Like above, but if number of Goals were equal, the number of Tries was used as a tie-breaker |
| 1886 - 1891 | 1 Point | 2 Points | 3 Points | 3 Points | N/A | |
| 1891 - 1894 | 2 Points | 3 Points | 3 Points | 4 Points | 4 Points | |
