# The History of Scoring in Rugby Union
-----
- The history of scoring in Rugby Union is a fascinating subject, and has seen numerous changes since the inception of rugby
    - For instance, the first 14 years of international rugby saw matches decided by the number of goals scored, rather than the number of points scored
- The table highlighted in this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rugby_union#Scoring) page will act as the guide for changes in scoring
    - This data is sourced from [Rugby Football History](https://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/), specifically their page on [Scoring Through the Ages](https://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm)

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1871 - 1875 | No Score | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | N/A | 1 | Matches decided by a majority of Goals. A Try was required to score a conversion-goal | `matchDate <= '1875-12-31'` |
| 1876 - 1885 | 1 Try | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | 1 Goal | N/A | 2 | Like above, but if number of Goals were equal, the number of Tries was used as a tie-breaker | `matchDate <= '1885-12-31'` |
